## 🚀 How It Works

The game is simple yet engaging. Here's how the process works:

1. **Theme Selection**: 
   - On the home page, the player selects one of the three available themes (Food, Animals, Nature). 
   - The theme choice is saved in the browser's `localStorage`, allowing the game to load theme-specific images for the cards.

2. **Shuffling the Cards**:
   - Once a theme is selected, the game board is generated by shuffling the cards in random order. 
   - Each card starts face-down, displaying a blank image.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - The player clicks on two cards to reveal their images. If the images match, the cards stay flipped; if not, they flip back after a brief pause. 
   - The game keeps track of the matches and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends when all pairs of cards have been successfully matched. A congratulatory message appears once all pairs are found.

5. **Restart Option**:
   - After completing the game, players can click the "Restart Game" button to choose a different theme and play again!

## 🛠️ How the Game Was Built

This game was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: To structure the web pages.
